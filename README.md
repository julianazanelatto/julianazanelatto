### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juliana Mascarenhas, and I've been working in the IT field since 2010. Today I'm Data Scientis with a focus on Network Data Science, and I work as a Tech Education Specialist at DIO. I'm also a content creator on Youtube channels SR and SP. So... you can see now that I love contributing to the community by creating articles, videos and sharing valuable information about IT careers.
